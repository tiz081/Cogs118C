Fourier Transform - Periodogram
	Discrete Fourier Transform
	abs(DFT)**^2

	Mathematical representation
		P(f_k = \frac{k}{T}) = [X[k]]^2

	Example estimate provides peak at 2Hz
	
	Increasing the duration of the data (T) increases frequency precision(resolution)
		\delta f = \frac{1}{T}
		increasing duration decreases spacing between bands meaning more easy to
			tell the frequency, but the noise has not gotten better

Welch's method - a better PSD estimation
	Designate an estimator with lower variance
		variance here is referring to the similar shape but varying fluctuations of 				the signal

	Want to smooth out the PSD
		Divide data into windows
		i.e. 50 seconds divided into 10 second chunks
			noise is independent of each other since each chunk is independent
			For each chunk calculate PSD and then avg

	Much less noise but has tradeoff: Frequency resolution is less precise since the 	durations are shorter
